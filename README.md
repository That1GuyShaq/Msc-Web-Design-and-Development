# Assignment Overview

**Flowers4U** is a local florist in Lusaka that wants to expand their business and offer flower selection and delivery services though their website **“_Flowers4U.co.zm_”**. The florist specializes in offering customers a range of flowers and bouquets for different occasions throughout the year. Flowers4U wants a simple website that allows customers to browse a selection of flowers and submit a delivery request through a form. The delivery dates of the flowers should be selectable on a form and the payment will be settled upon delivery (including an additional delivery fee). Once a form is submitted by the customer, an email will be sent to <admin@flowers4u.co.zm> and the store manager will manually create the invoice and delivery confirmation that will be sent back to the customer.

## Deliverables

Create a static website that Flowers4U can use to allow customers to order flowers online. Your website should include the following.

- Homepage and About Us
- Flower request form which includes;
  - Flower choice and quantity
  - Customer details (i.e. name, address, mobile number)
  - A choice of delivery dates and hours
  - Additional requests
- Contact information (including mail:to)
- Flower ranges and prices (include images, but ensure they are accredited appropriately)
- Occasion types and Delivery Terms

## Notes

You are required to use HTML and CSS only for coding and therefore it is not necessary to connect your site to a database.

- Any forms you create should have the necessary validation on input and lead to a separate page (you can decide the type of message)
- Use an external CSS Stylesheet
- Add dummy text to fill in pages (use a loren ipsum generator)
- Make appropriate use of an typefaces (fonts) and color for styling your pages, body text and heading elements.
- Comment your HTML and CSS documents appropriately
